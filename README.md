## Details
Developed in Java (Processing) as a team of 3: a story writer, and artist / programmer, and me - the lead developer. The first version available on [itch.io](https://16bite-studios.itch.io/speace) was fully thought-up and created in under 36h, and the project was then cleaned up and improved in some areas in the following days, along with a few more features such as persistent multi-level progression being added.
